/**

This protocol defines the associations between genotype
and phenotype (G2P).  Associations can be made as a
result of literature curation, computational modeling,
inference, etc., and modeled and shared using this schema.

Here, we follow the dogma of:

      Genotype + Environment = Phenotype

where a G2P association is between the G(enotype) in the context of
some E(environment), which gives rise to a P(henotype). These
associations have further evidence, provenance, and attribution.

We leverage the GenomicFeature in the sequenceAnnotation schema here
as it can accomodate any genomic feature from a single nucleotide variation
(SNV), up through a gene, and/or complex rearrangements.  Each can
be modeled as genomic features, and generally linked to a phenotype.
Collections of these features can represent a genotype at different levels
of completeness.  Therefore, we can represent single allelic variation,
allelic complement, and multiple variants in a genotype that can each or
collectively be associated with a phenotype.

To enable standardized integration, this schema relies heavily on
OntologyTerms, both for typing phenotype (for example, using the HPO or DO)
but also genomic features (such as using SO) and levels of evidence
(ECO).
